# nekRS (GPU) vs Nek5000 (CPU)

The goal of this work is to run a NekRS case (turbPipePeriodic) under the same conditions and parameters as the straight pipe pipe_STAT Nek5000 case to compare their performance and more specifically their runtime. 

Simulations were run for an endtime of 0.3, 3 and 30 and more details on their performance are found in the log file.
